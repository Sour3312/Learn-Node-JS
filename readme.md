# Node.js Overview

## Introduction
Node.js is a single-threaded, asynchronous, and event-driven runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is widely used for building fast, scalable, and cross-platform applications.

## Features & Advantages
1. **Asynchronous & Non-Blocking**: Node.js handles operations asynchronously, allowing for efficient management of multiple tasks without blocking the execution thread.
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Ideal for applications such as chat apps and gaming, where real-time updates are essential.
3. **Powered by V8 Engine**: Node.js uses Google's V8 engine, ensuring high performance and fast execution of JavaScript code.
4. **Scalability**: Easily scales across multiple servers, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
5. **Cross-Platform**: Runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Disadvantages
1. **Not Optimal for CPU-Intensive Tasks**: Node.js may struggle with applications that require heavy CPU computation.
2. **Challenges with Multithreading**: While Node.js is single-threaded, it can be complex to handle multithreading in large applications.

## Async-Await vs Promises
- **Promises**: Used for handling asynchronous operations and allow chaining.
- **Async-Await**: Simplifies the syntax of promises, making asynchronous code look more like synchronous code, improving readability and error handling.

## Core Concepts
1. **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: A tool for managing packages and dependencies in Node.js applications.
2. **Package.json**: A file that holds metadata about the project, including dependencies, scripts, and configurations.
3. **Node_modules**: The directory where all project dependencies are stored.
4. **Single/Multi-threading**: Node.js is single-threaded but can handle concurrent operations using its event loop and non-blocking I/O model.
5. **Browser vs Node**: While both run JavaScript, Node.js provides server-side capabilities and doesn't include browser-specific APIs like `window` or `document`.

## Modules
- **Built-in Modules**: Core modules such as `http`, `fs`, `path`, `os` and `events` come bundled with Node.js.
- **Custom Modules**: User-defined modules that encapsulate specific functionality.
- **Third-Party Modules**: External packages, often installed via NPM, that extend Node.js functionality (e.g., Express, Axios).

## Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
- **Events**: Actions or occurrences that trigger responses.
- **Event Emitters**: Objects that trigger or emit events.
- **Event Queues**: Manage the order of events and their handling.
- **Event Handlers/Listeners**: Functions that respond to specific events.
- **Event Loop**: Continuously checks the event queue and processes events asynchronously.

## Conclusion
Node.js provides a powerful, fast, and scalable platform for building a variety of applications, particularly those requiring real-time interactions. Understanding its core concepts, event-driven nature, and asynchronous handling mechanisms is crucial for developing efficient Node.js applications.

## Function vs event, Express, node js vs express js

## advantage of express
1. easy to use/minimun code
2. midlleware support
3. flexible routing system
4. template engine integration (can send html or any content dynamically)
    - ejs
    - pug
    - handlebar/mustache
